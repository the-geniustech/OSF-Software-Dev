#### **Week 22: Email & Notifications**

**Objective:** Teach students how to send transactional emails and notifications, both essential for many web applications (e.g., order confirmations, password resets).

1. **Sending Transactional Emails (Nodemailer):**

   - **Nodemailer:** Use Nodemailer to send transactional emails (e.g., user registration, password reset).
   - **SMTP Configuration:** Set up an SMTP server (or use a service like SendGrid) to send emails from the application.
   - Hands-on: Create a system where users receive an email upon registration or after placing an order.

2. **Setting Up Email Templates and SMTP Configurations:**

   - **Email Templates:** Create and use HTML-based email templates for sending professional, branded emails.
   - **SMTP Services:** Discuss using external SMTP services (e.g., Mailgun, SendGrid) for large-scale email sending.
   - Hands-on: Design a reusable email template and configure SMTP for sending it.

3. **Implementing Notification Systems (Email, SMS):**

   - **Email Notifications:** Set up a system to send email notifications to users based on specific triggers (e.g., order confirmation, new message).
   - **SMS Notifications:** Integrate SMS services (e.g., Twilio) to send SMS notifications for important updates.
   - Hands-on: Implement a notification system that sends email and SMS alerts based on user actions.

4. **Push Notifications (Using Web Push):**
   - **Web Push:** Introduce Web Push to send real-time push notifications to users’ browsers (even when the website is not open).
   - Hands-on: Implement Web Push notifications for real-time updates (e.g., new messages or order status changes).

#### **Week 23: Cloud Deployment & Scaling**

**Objective:** Equip students with knowledge of deploying and scaling Node.js applications in the cloud, focusing on continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and application monitoring.

1. **Deploying Applications to Cloud Platforms (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean):**

   - **Cloud Platforms Overview:** Introduce different cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) and their strengths.
   - **Deploying to Heroku:** Walk students through deploying an Express.js app to Heroku, covering environment variables, app scaling, and custom domains.
   - Hands-on: Deploy a fully functioning Node.js application to Heroku.

2. **Understanding CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions):**

   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Explain the importance of automated testing and deployment in modern web development.
   - **GitHub Actions:** Use GitHub Actions to create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically tests and deploys the application when changes are pushed to the repository.
   - Hands-on: Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for a Node.js app.

3. **Scaling Node.js Applications (Clustering, PM2):**

   - **Node.js Clustering:** Use Node.js’s built-in clustering to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, improving application performance under heavy load.
   - **PM2:** Introduce PM2, a process manager for Node.js, and use it to manage and scale Node.js applications in production.
   - Hands-on: Set up PM2 to manage a deployed Node.js application, enabling automatic restarts, scaling, and monitoring.

4. **Monitoring Applications (Log Management, APM Tools):**
   - **Log Management:** Set up centralized logging systems (e.g., using Winston or Loggly) to track application errors and performance in real-time.
   - **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Introduce APM tools (e.g., New Relic, Datadog) to monitor application performance, server load, and response times.
   - Hands-on: Set up basic application monitoring and log management for a deployed app, enabling early detection of issues.

#### **Week 24: Capstone Project**

**Objective:** Allow students to integrate everything they have learned over the last six months into a full-fledged, real-world application, which they will present as their final project.

1. **Building a Full-Stack Application:**

   - **Project Overview:** Students will build a full-stack application using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and all the technologies they’ve learned (authentication, payment integration, real-time features, etc.).
   - **Project Features:** The project should include user authentication (using JWT or Passport.js), payment processing (Stripe/Paystack), real-time features (WebSockets), and more.
   - Hands-on: Spend two weeks building, testing, and refining the project.

2. **Final Project Presentation and Review:**

   - **Project Presentation:** Students will present their capstone projects to the class, explaining the technologies used, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
   - **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough review of each student’s project, providing constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

3. **Next Steps: Career Advice, Portfolio Building, Job Interviews:**
   - **Portfolio Building:** Guide students on how to showcase their final projects on a portfolio website.
   - **Resume Preparation:** Provide tips on how to highlight technical skills on resumes.
   - **Job Interviews:** Conduct mock technical interviews, focusing on back-end concepts and problem-solving skills.

### **Optional Extras/Extensions:**

These topics can be covered as optional sessions or self-paced learning resources for advanced students.

- **Advanced TypeScript in Node.js:** Use TypeScript to add static types to Node.js applications, improving code quality and maintainability.
- **Microservices Architecture with Node.js:** Explore microservices architecture and how to split a monolithic Node.js application into smaller, independent services.
- **Dockerizing Node.js Applications:** Learn how to containerize Node.js applications using Docker, making them easier to deploy and scale.
- **Real-Time Collaboration Features with WebSockets:** Build real-time collaboration tools (e.g., shared document editing or real-time drawing apps) using WebSockets.
- **Working with Redis for Caching and Scaling:** Introduce Redis as a caching layer to speed up database queries and scale Node.js applications.
- **GraphQL API Optimizations with Apollo Server:** Optimize GraphQL APIs using Apollo Server, including caching, batching, and schema stitching for microservices.
